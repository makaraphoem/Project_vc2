        <h4>MISSION</h4>
        <p>
          Passerelles num√©riques is a non-profit organization under French law,
          created in 2005, operating in three Asian countries: Cambodia, the
          Philippines, Vietnam and Madagascar. Our mission is to provide
          education, technical and professional training in the digital sector
          to young underprivileged people by leveraging their potential and
          willpower. We endeavour to truly develop their employability which
          will allow them and their families to escape poverty in a sustainable
          way, and contribute to the social and economic development of their
          countries. Our beneficiaries are typically underprivileged or
          disadvantaged, in extremely precarious situations, according to the
          criteria PN has defined/specified for each of the countries in which
          it operates.
